ECG- Image based Heartbeat classification for Arrhythmia Detection Using IBM Watson Studio

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 
one cause of death today. Over 17.7 million people died from CVDs in the year 2017 all over the world 
which is about 31% of all deaths, and over 75% of these deaths occur in low and middle-income countries. 
Arrhythmia is a representative type of CVD that refers to any irregular change from the normal heart rhythms.
There are several types of arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, premature contraction, ventricular fibrillation, and tachycardia. 
Although a single arrhythmia heartbeat may not have a serious impact on life, continuous arrhythmia beats can result in fatal circumstances. 
In this project, we build an effective electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia classification method using a convolutional neural network (CNN), 
in which we classify ECG into seven categories, 
one being normal and the other six being different types of arrhythmia using deep two-dimensional CNN with grayscale ECG images. 
We are creating a web application where the user selects the image which is to be classified. The image is fed into the model 
that is trained and the cited class will be displayed on the webpage.

## Hardware Components used
Since we are using the IBM cloud as a platform to execute this project 
we don’t need any hardware components other than our system. 
## Software Components Used
We will be using Anaconda Navigator which is installed in our system 
and Watson studio from the IBM cloud to complete the project. 
### Anaconda Navigator 
Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R 
programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. 
It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.Conda is an open-source, cross-platform, 
package management system. Anaconda comes with so very nice tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, 
QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code. For this project, we will be using Jupiter notebook and spyder.
### Watson Studio
Watson Studio is one of the core services in Cloud Pak for Data as a Service. 
Watson Studio provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. 
You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, or to build machine learning models. 
This illustration shows how the architecture of Watson Studio is centered around the project. 
A project is a workspace where you organize your resources and work with data. 
● Deployment spaces are provided by the Watson Machine Learning service 
You can easily move assets between projects and deployment spaces
